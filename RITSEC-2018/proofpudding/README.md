As the name of the challenge suggests, the key to solving it is Prüfer sequences. 

The relation between Prüfer sequences and labeled trees (acyclic, connected graphs) is one-to-one. In other 
words, a given tree/graph generates a unique Prüfer sequence. 

The Prüfer sequence of a graph is generated by iteratively removing the node with the smallest value until you are left 
with two nodes. Every time you remove a node, you record the node that it was connected to. The sequence of a graph with
n nodes will have n-2 entries. More reading here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%BCfer_sequence

From there, one observes that each of the Prüfer sequences generated for the trees in the project description has a sum 
that is less than 26. The sums correspond to letters in the alphabet. Therein lies the flag, ignoring a couple of l33t 
substitutions.
